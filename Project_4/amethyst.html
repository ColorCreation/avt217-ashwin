				<h2>Healing Properties</h2>
				
				<p>Amethyst healing properties are as plentiful as the stone itself. It is thought of mostly as a 
				protective stone. As it is linked to the crown chakra, it is helpful in purifying the mind and 
				clearing it of negative thoughts. This includes the negativity of stress and anxiety, which is why 
				many meditate with amethyst so as to rid themselves of that darkness. Amethyst healing properties 
				are especially useful in regards to work-related stress, because the stone is also associated with 
				abundance; therefore relieving stress while emanating prosperity. The amethyst properties which 
				facilitate intuition and communication can also be applied to increased work effectiveness.</p>
				
				<h2>Meanings</h2>
				
				<p>Using amethyst to decorate the home is a choice many make for its appearance, alone. However, 
				the stone can have many metaphysical benefits as well if placed in the right room. An amethyst in 
				the family room can assist in familial bonding time, and provide the confidence and calm necessary 
				for open communication. Amethyst in the office will bring intuition for making tough, gut decisions 
				in business, and stress-relief for long work days. Placing an amethyst somewhere in the bathroom is 
				another way to relieve anxiety during a soothing bath.</p>
				
				<p>Amethyst is the birthstone for February, and known as the Zodiac stone for pisces. It is also 
				linked to the element of Wind. This element is believed to activate the mind, and assist in 
				clairvoyance and intuition. It is the ideal stone for meditation that seeks to discover the reason 
				for certain behaviors or actions, both on the part of oneself, or another. Whether you are looking 
				to meditate for relaxation, abundance, protection or communication, a good mantra is: "I trust 
				myself, I see what I need and it will come to me."</p>
