				<h2>Healing Properties</h2>
				
				<p>Know thyself but on your own terms. Belief systems? Meh. Gender roles? Who needs ' em? Onyx 
				healing properties sheds light on your inner truth in meditation practice because it's a chance 
				for a one-on-one with you and the universe. This dark and brooding quartz keeps the mind free of 
				societal expectations and self-doubt, leaving just you and your authentic self to contemplate your 
				existencewithin the vast universe. </p>
				
				<p>Sounds intense but don't take yourself too seriously during your therapeutic session, especially 
				if your mind is prone to wondering. In fact, meditating with the Onyx crystal is an excellent way to 
				take stock of your current state of being. Notice what thoughts creep up and distract you. Is it 
				memories from the past? A foreboding of the future? Whatever thoughts are holding you back from your 
				full potential, toss them to the side and brush that dirt off your shoulder. Once your mind is clear 
				and receptive, let the Onyx take you to the magical world of dusk, a special time when darkness 
				gives way to light.</p>
				
				<p>It's a matter of black and white when it comes to the Onyx crystal healing properties. Combine it 
				with white crystals like Selenite and Clear quartz to encourage wholeness and harmony within your 
				space. Just like the male and female energies and the moon and the sun, black and white are opposites 
				in nature, yet they can't exist without the other. There must be light to cast ashadow and vice 
				versa, making the contrast of black-and-white an essential healing tool that syncs up with the 
				duality of the universe. Black crystals like Onyx offer protection and security while white provides 
				clarity and new beginnings, giving perfect balance to your heart and spirit.</p>
				
				<h2>Meanings</h2>
				
				<p>Echoing the stillness of the night sky, the Onyx crystal stone meaning symbolizes initiation and 
				change in Peruvian and Native American traditions because it inspires feelings of personal power 
				that comes from facing your fears. Being free of garden-variety phobias is like having a super 
				power. It frees your soul from the shackles of self-doubt and anxiety by guiding you to a richer, 
				more meaningful existence.</p>
				
				<p>Tune into the deep black void of nighttime, a restorative time when the world is quiet and calm, 
				and focus on Onyx to free you of everyday fears. While the sun energizes us by day, a moonlit sky 
				restores us by night. These are the moments when real change and spiritual transformation is 
				possible, which makes the Onyx crystal an essential part of your stone collection for spiritual 
				awakenings.</p>
				
				<p>Featuring black deep black with white and gray bands of color, Onyx symbolizes the three 
				different phases of our ever-spinning planet. Black represents the cool and still night skies, gray 
				is the sky at predawn and dusk, and white is the color of the everyday. In the world of fairytales 
				the magic always takes place at dusk or dawn, the time when all is still in the glow of twilight. 
				Together, these colors represent the interconnectedness of black and white, the yin-yang of the 
				universe, which helps restore balance to the root chakra. The healing properties of Onyx are a gem 
				at soothing the stress of everyday life because it works tobring harmony to the work-life balance 
				with its grounding effects that make you feel safe and anchors you to the earth. Feel forever 
				frazzled or include Onyx into your daily wellness routine.</p>
