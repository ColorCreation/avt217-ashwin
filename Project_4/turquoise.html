				<h2>Meanings</h2>
				
				<p>In crystal healing, the Turquoise crystal stone meaning is associated with personal protection, 
				making it a popular protective shield for ancient warriors heading out into battle. The bright and 
				stunning hue of the Turquoise crystal has been discovered in the ceremonial masks and battle gear 
				of the Aztecs, a tribe that revered this decorative stone for its ability to provide personal 
				protection against negative forces. In the case of the ancients, it served as a bodyguard against 
				invading marauders and other challenges of antiquity. According to Persian legend, the Turquoise 
				crystal stone was believed to bring good luck when it reflected the light of the new moon.</p>
				
				<p>A protective stone used for thousands of years, Turquoise is the spiritual balm to a heart that's 
				been chapped by old emotional wounds and chronic stress. Modern life might not be a Game of Thrones 
				episode, but it does have its share of eyebrow-raising moments. Wherever you happen to be on your 
				journey, let Turquoise be your welcome oasis in a spiritual desert, a stone with energetic 
				vibrations linked to the life-giving elements of water and air.</p>
				
				<p>French for the word 'Turkish,' the Turquoise crystal meaning became well known across the 
				continents, thanks to the ancient trades routes of the Silk Road, which brought this valuable stone 
				from Turkey to Western Europe. Turquoise quickly became the toast of Europe, making its way into 
				royal lineage that can be traced back to Marie-Louise and her royal tiara, a wedding gift from her 
				husband Napoleon I.</p>
