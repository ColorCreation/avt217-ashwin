				<h2>Healing Properties</h2>
				
				<p>Aquamarine properties contain the healing, vibrant powers of our ancient seas. Evolved over 
				millions of years, this stone rocks when it comes to soothing unpleasant emotions such as grief or 
				loneliness. Aquamarine is an essential component to a healing crystal collection because it helps 
				to reconnect us to the life-giving waters of the earth. Summoning the legendary spirit of seafarers, 
				sailors, and magical mermaids, this gemstone reflects the deep layers of our vast oceans and its 
				various shades of cool blues and greens. Aquamarine is also known to enhance feelings of 
				peacefulness by encouraging inner strength and bravery, whatever the situation.</p>
				
				<p>A simple and effective way for the modern mermaid to benefit from Aquamarine is with a cleansing 
				and rejuvenating beauty ritual. Belonging to the mineral type beryl, which includes emeralds, 
				Aquamarine is known for its incredible anti-aging effects. For youthful and vibrant skin at any age, 
				make beauty water with pieces of raw Aquamarine, which works best for this cleansing water. First, 
				cleanse your crystals with warm filtered water, making sure that it's free of dirt and loose 
				particles. Keep in mind that it's common for these crystals to still have earth on them because of 
				their natural state.</p>
				
				<p>Once the crystals are clean, place them in a glass bowl and cover with filtered water. At sunrise, 
				set the ball in direct sunlight and let the gemstones absorb the amazing power of the sun. If it's a 
				full moon, you also have the option of placing the Aquamarine stones under the moonlight overnight. 
				Now that you have a beauty water infused and activated with Aquamarine healing properties, splash 
				on your face in the morning and night while saying self love affirmations such as "I amworthy," "I 
				love myself," or another mantra that speaks to your true inner spirit. Refill the bowl with water 
				and return it to the sunlight or under the moonlight, and always have a constant supply of 
				invigorating and soothing Aquamarine water, a rejuvenating addition to your daily skincare routine.</p>
				
				<h2>Meanings</h2>
				
				<p>"Aqua" is the Latin word for water and "marine" means "of the sea,dz which signifies the Aquamarine 
				stone meaning and its link to ancient water kingdoms. True Aquamarine features a stunning, translucent 
				pale turquoise, which makes it popular for incorporating into jewelry design. Because of its 
				connection to the sea, this healing crystal works to clear and cleanse the water element within our 
				bodies, which is crucial to health and wellness, especially since we're made up of 70% water. By 
				reconnecting us to earthâ€™s life giving water element, Aquamarine helps to remove emotional toxicity 
				and encourage feelings of inner peace.</p>
