				<h2>Healing Properties</h2>
				
				<p>If you're feeling spiritually adrift, meditate with Bloodstone to stimulate the root chakra, the 
				energy center that provides a sense of security and safety on the earth. Bloodstone properties work 
				to guide your lost soul by helping you see change on the horizon and face the transformation with a 
				renewed sense of resilience and vigor. In other words, it serves as a protective talisman that gives 
				you strength and courage to brave the storm.</p>
				
				<p>Like the blood pumping through your circulatory system and to the heart, Bloodstone healing 
				properties rock when it comes to regeneration of cells and tissue, making it a go-to for wound 
				healing. The same goes for healing emotional wounds, which makes the Bloodstone stone meaning an 
				essential part of yourhealing crystal first aid kit. Feeling especially moody? Bloodstone is also 
				an effective mood stabilizer in the world of crystal healing.</p>
				
				<p>Bloodstone boosts the innate healing power inside you by quieting a preoccupiedmind and 
				refocusing your energy on repair and renewal of wounds you've collected over the years. Keep 
				Bloodstone with you everywhere you go and take on the day with a renewed sense of confidence and 
				inner strength.</p>
				
				<h2>Meanings</h2>
				
				<p>The best way to access the powerful and courageous vibes of Bloodstone is to create a sacred 
				healing space free of clutter, to-do lists, cell phones, and anything else that might be a 
				distraction. Make the environment ultra comfy with a cushion, yoga mat, or blanket and set the mood 
				with an aromatherapy lamp or scented candle.</p>
				
				<p>Before you begin your meditation practice, clear and cleanse the energy of the room with your 
				favorite incense or sage smudge stick. Hold the Bloodstone crystal in your hand and set your 
				intention while meditating, a powerful way to manifest its healing properties.</p>
				
				<p>If you have too much energy to mediate in a sedentary position, walking meditation is also an 
				excellent way to replace negative thought patterns with more productive and creative ones that 
				inspire action instead of paralysis. While holding the Bloodstone in your hand, walk through a 
				forest or other beautiful and serene natural setting, and feel the Bloodstone helping to deepen 
				and expand your connection to nature.</p>
				
				<p>Created from a dark and moody combination of Chalcedony and Red Jasper, Bloodstone healing 
				properties can be constantly accessed by wearing jewelry made with its striking colors of intense 
				green with blood red or orange oxide spots.</p>
				
				<p>Even when life gives you more gutter balls than strikes, remember that challenges make life 
				interesting and overcoming them makes them meaningful. As the ancientproverb says, "Your best 
				teacher is your last mistake."</p>
